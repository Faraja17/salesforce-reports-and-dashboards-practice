## Overview

I'm interested in learning Salesforce because it facilitates data management. My current employer has an account. We are currently experimenting with it to learn how it can help us with our fundraising and programming data, but we don't yet have a certified administrator. I have been learning about how to use Salesforce on the Trailhead website. This documents my first project.

## My process

I simply followed the trail. At first, I viewed the video, paused, tried things out, and then read through or skimmed the text version of the tutorial. As I gained confidence and comfort, I switched to reading the text and completing the steps, then watching the video to verify. I noticed that the instructor added important tips and guidance, so it was beneficial for me both to view the videos and read thoroughly through the text version. I created several customized reports and a related dashboard to address the following imaginary stakeholder reporting needs:

| Stakeholder       | Reporting Requirements |
| :---------------- | :------------------- 
| VP of Sales        |   •Simple report showing all of her sales teams' opportunities, by rep, that have been closed won this year. <br> •Report showing opportunities by rep, grouped by Close Date and displayed in a table. <br> •Matrix report showing opportunities by owner, stage, and size in the pipeline this fiscal quarter. <br> •Report showing percentage of closed opportunities being won. <br> •Visual comparison of sales rep win rates. <br> •Dashboard to display key information from her sales reports, which is also to be accessible by her team.   |
| VP of Marketing           |   •List of all customer accounts based in Texas, North Carolina, Illinois, and New York that have either a rating of Hot or Warm or an annual revenue over $2 million.   |
| CEO    |  •Ability to export and manipulate a report in spreadsheet software.   |

### Built with

- Salesforce Hands-on Org also known as a Salesforce Playground

### What I learned

I learned how Salesforce makes it easier for stakeholders such as department heads, VPs and CEOs to review organizational data with ease and efficiency. Through this project, I practiced harnessing the power of Report Builder to customize Salesforce objects and fields into meaningful information. Filter logic, various report types including matrix (pivot) tables, charts, and dashboards (used to create stories) can further segment data for highlighting the most important information. I learned that Salesforce can save the executive team a lot of time and energy in creating customized reports and dashboards. I also learned more about how to interpret the stakeholder reporting needs and translate them into effective reports and dashboards.

I am learning that Systems Management via Salesforce/Service Now is a good fit for me. Both involve creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and data analytics. Both would allow me to leverage my coding skills.

### Continued development

This is only the beginning in my Salesforce education. My goal is to learn more about how to program, customize, and connect other organizational platforms to our Salesforce account. Eventually, I would like to become certified in both the Salesforce and Service Now platforms.
